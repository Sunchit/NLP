ü§ñ SIMPLE RAG DEMO FOR STUDENTS
=====================================

What is RAG?
- R: Retrieval (Find relevant information)
- A: Augmented (Add it to your question) 
- G: Generation (Create a smart answer)

Think of it like having a smart assistant that:
1. Searches through books to find relevant pages
2. Reads those pages to understand the context
3. Gives you an answer based on what it found

This demo uses simple Python libraries that students can understand!
